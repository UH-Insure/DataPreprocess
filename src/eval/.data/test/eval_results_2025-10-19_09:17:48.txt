=== Task 1 ===

[PROMPT]
### Instruction:
    Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below
    Output exactly one code block in the format ```cryptol ...``` and nothing else — no explanation, no extra text. The file should be valid Cryptol source that can be loaded by the Cryptol tool and by SAW.

    ### Request:
    Task: Implement a function named `xor8` which takes two 8-bit words and returns their bitwise XOR. Also provide a constant `zero8` equal to 0 (8-bit).
    
[GENERATED CODE]
xor8 : [8] -> [8] -> [8]
xor8 x y = x ^ y

zero8 : [8]
zero8 = 0
  [PASS] test 1: OK
[RESULT] Task 1: ALL PASS


=== Task 2 ===

[PROMPT]
### Instruction:
    Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below
    Output exactly one code block in the format ```cryptol ...``` and nothing else — no explanation, no extra text. The file should be valid Cryptol source that can be loaded by the Cryptol tool and by SAW.

    ### Request:
    Task: Implement a function named `matrix` which takes no input and returns a 3 x 3 matrix of tuples. For the function use a nested comprehension to write an expression to produce a 3 × 3 matrix (as a sequence of sequences), such that the ijth entry contains the value (i, j).
    
[GENERATED CODE]
matrix = [[(i, j) | j <- [0..2]] | i <- [0..2]]
  [PASS] test 1: OK
[RESULT] Task 2: ALL PASS


=== Task 3 ===

[PROMPT]
### Instruction:
    Write a Cryptol function that implements the tasks described below
    Output exactly one code block in the format ```cryptol ...``` and nothing else — no explanation, no extra text. The file should be valid Cryptol source that can be loaded by the Cryptol tool and by SAW.

    ### Request:
    Task: Implement a function named `encrypt` that performs encryption on ASCII strings and a function named `decrypt` that performs decryption on ASCII strings. Each character must be shifted by the given key modulo 256.
    
[GENERATED CODE]
encrypt : [8] -> [8] -> [8]
encrypt key char = (key + char) % 256

decrypt : [8] -> [8] -> [8]
decrypt key char = (char - key) % 256
  [FAIL] test 1: Error: [error] at :1:1--1:8
    Value not in scope: encrypt {'errors': ['[error] at :1:1--1:8\n    Value not in scope: encrypt'], 'source': 'module name <interactive>', 'warnings': []}
[RESULT] Task 3: HAS FAILURES


=== Task 4 ===

[PROMPT]
### Instruction:
    Write a Cryptol property that tests the function described below.
    Output exactly one code block in the format ```cryptol ...``` and nothing else — no explanation, no extra text. The code block should contain valid Cryptol source that can be loaded by the Cryptol tool and by SAW.

    ### Request:
    Task: Using ONLY the names and types provided, write a monomorphic Cryptol property that proves decrypt inverts encrypt for a 512-byte plaintext.
