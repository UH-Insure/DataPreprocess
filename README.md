# DataPreprocess
This project for builds training and evaluation datasets for machine-learning models that generate or analyze formal specification languages such as Cryptol and SAWScript.
It provides a complete pipeline for:
- Recursively crawling multiple repositories
- Extracting Cryptol and SAW source files
- Cleaning and normalizing the files
- Pairing source code with appropriate instruction prompts
- Generating Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) datasets in chat format
- Producing evaluation suites used to measure model performance
- Caching filesystem queries to accelerate repeated processing
The repository is organized as a modular preprocessing toolkit that supports deterministic, repeatable dataset creation — suitable for research, experiments, and training large language models.
